# PlanetaryIO

PlanetaryIO is a simplified planetary energy budget simulator for an Earth-like planet.  

You can use the simulation at https://planetaryio.herokuapp.com

Please get in touch if  you have any suggestions or interesting ways you use this
in the classroom!

## Running PlanetaryIO

This application needs Python 3.x with the packages, bokeh and numby installed.
After cloning/downloading the files,
navigate to the parent directory of PlanetaryIO (i.e. one folder up) and start the bokeh
server with:

    bokeh serve --show PlanetaryIO

This will start a bokeh server with the application and open it in
a window of your system's default browser.
